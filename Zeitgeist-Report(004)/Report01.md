### Keeping You Updated
### > 最新报告
Welcome back Seers. It’s been a blast getting to know our community, and now it is time to give an update to the world about the progress inside the Seer program. These first few months have been full of surprises and progress, and taught us at Zeitgeist a lot about the community that we have. We are so excited to move forward creating friendships, establishing a standard, and building with this new community.
> 欢迎回来！了解我们的社区是一件令人兴奋的事情，现在是时候向全世界介绍先知计划的最新进展了。最初的几个月里充满了惊喜和进展，在 Zeitgeist 发展的过程中我们学到了很多有关社区的知识。我们非常高兴能够与这个新社区建立友谊、建立标准并共同前进。

### The Birth of a Community
> ### 新社区的诞生

When we were forming the Seer program we had a list of goals in mind. We wanted to create a community that is fully inclusive, fosters collaboration, and gives members the opportunity to work towards their goals within the crypto community and the Zeitgeist ecosystem. At a certain point there was nothing left to do but invite the initial applicants to the program, and let the community show us who they are.
> 当我们制订先知计划的时候，我们心中已然有了一个目标清单。我们希望创建一个充满包容、互帮互助并且让成员们有机会在加密社区和 Zeitgeist 生态系统中朝着自己的目标努力的社区。从某种程度上来说，除了邀请申请者们加入该计划的初始阶段，并且通过社区介绍他们自己以外，我们别无他法。

We were so happy to see a much larger turn out for the program than we expected on the first round of applications. The Discord quickly grew to include over 400 members and community calls are being consistently attended by 50+ members! This was great news, and it is a beautiful thing to see so many people interested in building with Zeitgeist from all over the world.
> 我们感到非常高兴，因为第一轮的申请人数远远超过了我们的预期。我们的 Discord 很快发展到 400 多名成员，并且有 50 多名成员一直在参加社区电话会议！对 Zeitgeist 来说，能有那么多来自世界各地的人对 Zeitgeist 感兴趣，这是一件令人高兴的事情。

Now that this baseline community had been established it was time for us to get work and start building out the Seer program to fit the needs of such a diverse pool of individuals. We started working towards our original goals of an inclusive, collaborative, and progress oriented program by tackling the challenges presented to us.
> 现在，社区的基线已经建立，是时候让我们开始建设先知计划以满足社区成员们各种多样化的需求了。我们开始着手解决摆在我们面前的挑战，朝着我们最初的目标——建立一个充满包容、互帮互助并且让成员们有机会在加密社区和 Zeitgeist 生态系统中朝着自己的目标努力的社区。

### Erasing Borders
> ### 社区无国界

Though the Seer program was completely built out in English, it quickly became apparent that the vast majority of our community was not an English speaking community. This caught us by surprise, but we only ever saw it as the first challenge in the Seer program to overcome. We always planned to be an inclusive program, and we knew that supporting an international community was going to be a part of that. When it became apparent that the Discord was filled with 90% non-english speaking members, supporting this community quickly became our top priority.
> 先知计划其官方语言为英语，但很快我们就意识到，社区的绝大多数成员都不是说英语的。 这让我们感到意外，但我们只将其视为先知计划中要面临的第一个挑战。我们一直想让该计划成为一个开放性的项目，我们知道支持国际化将成为其中重要的一部分。当发现 Discord 中有 90% 的非英语成员时，尽快支持社区成为了我们的首要任务。

The first step we took toward localizing the program was the creation of the language based Liaison	teams. These Liaison teams were created with the goal of facilitating the flow of communication between the administrative staff of the Seer program and the community itself. With the help of some amazing volunteers we were quickly able to create 3 Liaison teams. One for our Russian speaking community, One for our Ukrainian speaking community, and One for our Turkish speaking community.
> 项目本地化的第一步是建立基于本地语言为基础的联络小组。创建这些联络小组的目的是促进先知计划的管理人员与社区本身之间的沟通交流。在一些优秀志愿者的帮助下，我们很快建立了 3 个联络小组。一个是俄语社区，一个是乌克兰语社区，一个是土耳其语社区。

The next step we took in our localization efforts is the Seer program Medium. This Medium page serves as a portal for our non English speaking communities where they can get information about the Seer program and find translated works about Zeitgeist itself. Moving forward we want the Seer program Medium to turn into a hosting platform for our community members to host their own content revolving around prediction markets, Futarchy, Zeitgeist, and the Seer program.
> 接下来，我们的下一步是建设 Seer program Medium，Medium  为我们的非英语社区提供了一个传送门，在那里他们可以获得关于先知计划的最新信息，并找到关于 Zeitgeist 本身的翻译文章。未来，我们希望 Seer program Medium 变成一个托管平台，让我们的社区成员可以围绕预测市场、Futarchy、Zeitgeist 和先知计划托管他们自己的创作内容。

### The Forefront of Progress
> ### 进步的前沿

In our last progress report we introduced the Vanguard initiative. This initiative was designed to give Seers who contribute to the growth of the Seer program itself a reward and distinguished title. So far in the Seer program there were 8 individuals who truly set themselves apart by contributing to the early growth and infrastructure of the Seer program. There has been a lot of contribution and teamwork dedicated to various aspects of the Seer program that may not be readily apparent, but is appreciated deeply by us at Zeitgeist. For their hard work they were given the first Seer program NFTs ever to be distributed, and granted the limited availability title of Vanguard.
> 在我们上次的进展报告中，我们介绍了先锋（Vanguard）计划。该计划旨在为对先知计划（Seer program）本身的发展做出贡献的先知给予奖励和授予荣誉称号。到目前为止，在先知计划中有 8 个人在为先知计划的早期发展和基础设施做出贡献的过程中脱颖而出。可以看到，先知计划的各个方面都有很多贡献者和团队协作，这些贡献者和团队协作可能并不明显，但在 Zeitgeist 中我们对此深表赞赏。由于他们的辛勤工作，他们将获得有史以来第一个先知计划 NFT，并授予“先锋官”的限定称号。

There has been a lot of progress in the Seer program outside of the Vanguard Initiative too. In our last progress report we had just opened up the Seer program to our initial applicants that we pulled from the KSM Derby discord. Everything was a fresh experience, and nobody had earned a Seer title or participated in the program yet. Since then, the program has swelled to a staggering 471 members with 172 of those members successfully obtaining their Seer title. With these members came a flood of community content taking various forms. Articles, videos, art, and more. All focused on the Zeitgeist Ecosystem and the Seer program itself.
> 除了先锋计划，先知计划也取得了很多进展。在我们上次的进展报告中，我们拉取了从 KSM Derby discord 中获取的申请名单，并且刚刚向这些申请者开放了先知计划。一切都是全新的体验，并且至今为止，还没有人获得过先知称号，也没有人参与过该计划。从那时起，该计划的成员人数已增至惊人的 471 人，其中 172 人成功获得了先知称号。随着这些成员的加入，各种形式的社区内容大量涌现，包括文章、视频、艺术品等等。这些内容都为围绕着 Zeitgeist 生态系统和先知计划本身。

### Looking Forward
> ### 未来可期

It has been a pleasure to meet, work, and create with all of the members of the Seer program over the last few months. As we move forward with the program we will start to shift focus on more direct engagement with the community. Now that we have our communication rails established, we want to use them to help give direction to our community and provide the resources needed to help members of the community contribute and participate.
> 在过去的几个月里，我们很高兴与先知计划的所有成员会面、工作和创造。随着计划的推进，我们将开始将重点转移到与社区更直接的互动上。现在我们已经建立了沟通渠道，我们希望利通过他们来指导我们的社区，并提供所需的资源来帮助社区成员做出贡献和参与。
